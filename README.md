# CMP-SWHE
Confused Module Projection based Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption BestiVictory/CMP-SWHE algorithm is based on the modulo projection theorem, the equivalence properties of congruences and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). This algorithm belongs to somewhat homomorphic encryption algorithm. On the client side, the original data is encrypted by amplification, randomization, and setting confusing redundancy. Operating on the ciphertext on the server side is equivalent to operating on the original data. As an extension, we designed and implemented a blind computing scheme of accelerated version based on batch processing technology to improve efficiency. We did a lot of experiments to test our scheme and applied it to blind foreground extraction, blind optical flow tracking and blind face detection. We also extend the algorithm to applications of deep learning. Experimental results show that although our algorithm has some tiny errors (10−6 )it is very efficient and practical, especially suitable for image and video processing, which does not require high accuracy.

## Environment
The project code needs to run on ***OpenCV, cryptopp565*** and ***miracl*** libraries，you can get them by clicking [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zEkdfzsscyeBIaiGealjCw)
